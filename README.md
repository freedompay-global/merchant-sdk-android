# Getting Started

&emsp;Before you begin integrating the **Freedom Merchant SDK** into your Android app, ensure you have the following:
- An Android app project with a minimum API level of 28.

---
# Installation Instructions

## 1. Add JitPack repository

&emsp;Add JitPack to your project's `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencyResolutionManagement {
  repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") } // Add this line
  }
}
```

## 2. Add Dependency
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.freedompay-global:merchant-sdk-android:${specifyTheLatestVersion}")
}
```

## 3. Sync the project

# SDK integration

## Initialize

&emsp;To initialize the **Freedom Merchant SDK**, call the `create` method of the `FreedomAPI` class. This method requires *three parameters*:
> **NOTE**
> - Your merchant ID
> - Your merchant secret key
> - The payment region
```kotlin
val merchantId = "123456"
val secretKey = "123456789ABCDEF"
val region = Region.KZ
val freedomApi = FreedomAPI.create(merchantId, secretKey, region)
```
### Table: `Region`
| Enum Constant | Description        |
|---------------|--------------------|
| `KZ`          | Kazakhstan region. |
| `RU`          | Russia region.     |
| `UZ`          | Uzbekistan region. |
| `KG`          | Kyrgyzstan region. |

---

# Integrating the PaymentView (Optional)

## Adding `PaymentView`

&emsp;Add the PaymentView to your activity's layout file:
 ```xml
<kz.freedompay.paymentsdk.api.view.PaymentView
    android:id="@+id/paymentView"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
 ```

## Connecting `PaymentView`

&emsp;Pass the instance of your PaymentView to the SDK:
```kotlin
freedomApi.setPaymentView(paymentView)
```

## Tracking Loading Progress (Optional)

&emsp;To track the loading progress of the payment page, use the `onLoadingStateChanged` listener:
```kotlin
paymentView.onLoadingStateChanged { isLoading: Boolean -> 
    // Handle loading state changes (e.g., show/hide a progress indicator)
}
```

---
# SDK Configuration

&emsp;The SDK's behavior is controlled through its configuration, which you manage using the `SdkConfiguration` data class. This class acts as a central container, encapsulating two key components: `UserConfiguration` for customer-specific settings and `OperationalConfiguration` for general operational parameters.

## `SdkConfiguration` Overview

The `SdkConfiguration` object is passed to the SDK via `freedomApi.setConfiguration()`.

```kotlin
data class SdkConfiguration(
    val userConfiguration: UserConfiguration = UserConfiguration(),
    val operationalConfiguration: OperationalConfiguration = OperationalConfiguration(),
)
```

### Table: `UserConfiguration`
&emsp;This data class holds customer-specific details.

| Property           | Type      | Description                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `userPhone`        | `String?` | Customer's phone number. If provided, it will be displayed on the payment page. If `null`, the user will be prompted to enter it.  |
| `userContactEmail` | `String?` | Customer's contact email.                                                                                                          |
| `userEmail`        | `String?` | Customer's email address. If provided, it will be displayed on the payment page. If `null`, the user will be prompted to enter it. |

### Table: `OperationalConfiguration`
&emsp;This data class contains general operational settings for the SDK.

| Property        | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Default Value                                                                   |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `testingMode`   | `Boolean?`    | Enables or disables test mode. If `null`, the value is inherited from the merchant's settings. A non-null value will override the merchant's setting.                                                                       | `null`                                                                          |
| `language`      | `Language?`   | Sets the language of the payment page. See [`Language`](#table-language) enum for available options.

| `lifetime`      | `Int`         | Duration, in seconds, for which the payment page remains valid for completing a payment.                                                                                                                                    | `1800`                                                                          |
| `autoClearing`  | `Boolean?`    | Activates automatic clearing of payments. If `null`, the value is inherited from the merchant's settings. A non-null value will override the merchant's setting.                                                            | `null`                                                                          |
| `checkUrl`      | `String?`     | URL to which the payment check will be sent.                                                                                                                                                                                | `null`                                                                          |
| `resultUrl`     | `String?`     | URL to which the payment result will be sent.                                                                                                                                                                               | `null`                                                                          |
| `requestMethod` | `HttpMethod?` | HTTP method used for requests to `checkUrl` or `resultUrl`. See [`HttpMethod`](#table-httpmethod) enum. Defaults to `GET` if `checkUrl` or `resultUrl` is set.                                                              | `HttpMethod.GET` (if `checkUrl` or `resultUrl` is not `null`, otherwise `null`) |

### Table: `Language`
| Enum Constant | Description                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| `KZ`          | SDK uses the `Kazakh` language.  |
| `RU`          | SDK uses the `Russian` language. |
| `EN`          | SDK uses the `English` language. |

### Table: `HttpMethod`
| Enum Constant | Description                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| `GET`         | SDK uses the HTTP `GET` method.  |
| `POST`        | SDK uses the HTTP `POST` method. |

## Applying the Configuration
&emsp;To apply your desired SDK configuration, create an instance of `SdkConfiguration` and pass it to the `freedomApi.setConfiguration()` method:

```kotlin
val myUserConfig = UserConfiguration(
    userPhone = "1234567890",
    userEmail = "user@example.com"
)

val myOperationalConfig = OperationalConfiguration(
    testingMode = false,
    language = Language.EN, // Using the provided Language enum
    lifetime = 600, // 10 minutes
    autoClearing = true,
    resultUrl = "https://example.com/result",
    requestMethod = HttpMethod.POST // Using the provided HttpMethod enum
)

val sdkConfiguration = SdkConfiguration(
    userConfiguration = myUserConfig,
    operationalConfiguration = myOperationalConfig
)

freedomApi.setConfiguration(sdkConfiguration)
```

# Working with the SDK

&emsp;This section details the primary methods available in the SDK for managing payments within your application.

## Create Payment page/frame
&emsp;To initiate a new payment transaction and display the payment page, call the `createPaymentPage` or `createPaymentFrame` method on your `FreedomAPI` instance. This method handles the presentation of the payment page/frame within the previously configured `PaymentView`.

> **WARNING**
> These methods require that a `PaymentView` has been set using [`freedomApi.setPaymentView()`](#integrating-the-paymentview-optional) prior to calling them.

&emsp;These methods accept several parameters to define the payment details:

| Parameter        | Type                                       | Description                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `paymentRequest` | `StandardPaymentRequest`                   | Essential details required to initiate a new payment. See [`StandardPaymentRequest`](#standardpaymentrequest-structure) model.                |
| `onResult`       | `(FreedomResult<PaymentResponse>) -> Unit` | Callback function that will be invoked upon the completion of the payment process. See [`PaymentResponse`](#paymentresponse-structure) model. |

&emsp;The process returns an [`FreedomResult<PaymentResponse>`](#error-handling-and-results) object, which can be either:
- **Success**: Contains a `PaymentResponse` object.
- **Error**: Specifies the type of error that occurred.

```kotlin
val paymentRequest = StandardPaymentRequest(
    amount = 123.45f,
    currency = Currency.KZT, // Using the provided Currency enum
    description = "Monthly Subscription",
    userId = "user12345",
    orderId = "SUB-2025-001",
)
freedomApi.createPaymentPage(
    paymentRequest = paymentRequest
) { result: FreedomResult<PaymentResponse> ->
    when (result) {
        is FreedomResult.Success -> {
            // Payment page processed successfully.
        }
        is FreedomResult.Error -> {
            // An error occurred during the payment process.
        }
    }
}
```

## Get Payment status
&emsp;To retrieve the current status of a previously initiated payment, use the `getPaymentStatus` method.

&emsp;This method takes these parameters:

| Parameter   | Type                              | Description                                                                                                            |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `paymentId` | `Long`                            | Unique identifier of the payment you want to check.                                                                    |
| `onResult`  | `(FreedomResult<Status>) -> Unit` | Callback function that will be invoked with the result of the payment status. See [`Status`](#status-structure) model. |

&emsp;The process returns an [`FreedomResult<Status>`](#error-handling-and-results) object, which can be either:
- **Success**: Contains a `Status` object.
- **Error**: Specifies the type of error that occurred.

```kotlin
freedomApi.getPaymentStatus(paymentId = 123456L) { result: FreedomResult<Status> ->
    when (result) {
        is FreedomResult.Success -> {
            // Payment status retrieved successfully.
        }
        is FreedomResult.Error -> {
            // Failed to retrieve payment status.
        }
    }
}
```

## Make Clearing Payment
> **NOTE**
> This method is specifically designed for merchants who have **auto-clearing disabled** in their SDK configuration. Auto-clearing can be managed via the `autoClearing` property within the [`OperationalConfiguration`](#table-operationalconfiguration) of your `SdkConfiguration`.

&emsp;Use the `makeClearingPayment` method to explicitly initiate the clearing (final capture) of funds for a previously authorized payment. This method gives you the flexibility to clear an amount that may be different from the original amount specified when the payment was created (e.g., for partial captures).

&emsp;This method takes these parameters:

| Parameter   | Type                                      | Description                                                                                                                                | Constraints/Notes                                                                                                      |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `paymentId` | `Long`                                    | Unique identifier of the payment you want to clear.                                                                                        |                                                                                                                        |
| `amount`    | `Float?`                                  | Amount to be cleared. If `null`, the full amount of the original authorized payment will be cleared.                                       | Optional. Defaults to null. Must be between `0.01` and `99999999.00` if provided. Cannot exceed the authorized amount. |
| `onResult`  | `(FreedomResult<ClearingStatus>) -> Unit` | Callback function that will be invoked with the result of the clearing operation. See [`ClearingStatus`](#clearingstatus-structure) model. |                                                                                                                        |

&emsp;The process returns an [`FreedomResult<ClearingStatus>`](#error-handling-and-results) object, which can be either:
- **Success**: Contains a `ClearingStatus` object.
- **Error**: Specifies the type of error that occurred.

```kotlin
freedomApi.makeClearingPayment(paymentId = 123456L) { result: FreedomResult<ClearingStatus> ->
    when (result) {
        is FreedomResult.Success -> {
            // Handle the clearing status.
        }
        is FreedomResult.Error -> {
            // Failed to clear the payment.
        }
    }
}
```

## Make Cancel Payment
> **NOTE**
> This method is specifically designed for merchants who have **auto-clearing disabled** in their SDK configuration. Auto-clearing can be managed via the `autoClearing` property within the [`OperationalConfiguration`](#table-operationalconfiguration) of your `SdkConfiguration`.

&emsp;Use the `makeCancelPayment` method to reverse an authorized payment, effectively unblocking the amount on the customer's card. This ensures that the funds will not be charged.

&emsp;This method takes these parameters:

| Parameter   | Type                                       | Description                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `paymentId` | `Long`                                     | Unique identifier of the payment you want to cancel.                                                                                           |
| `onResult`  | `(FreedomResult<PaymentResponse>) -> Unit` | Callback function that will be invoked with the result of the cancellation attempt. See [`PaymentResponse`](#paymentresponse-structure) model. |

&emsp;The process returns an [`FreedomResult<PaymentResponse>`](#error-handling-and-results) object, which can be either:
- **Success**: Contains a `PaymentResponse` object.
- **Error**: Specifies the type of error that occurred.

```kotlin
freedomApi.makeCancelPayment(paymentId = 123456L) { result: FreedomResult<PaymentResponse> ->
    when (result) {
        is FreedomResult.Success -> {
            // Cancellation attempt completed successfully.
        }
        is FreedomResult.Error -> {
            // Failed to cancel the payment.
        }
    }
}
```

## Make Revoke Payment
&emsp;The `makeRevokePayment` method allows you to process a full or partial refund for a completed payment.

&emsp;This method takes these parameters:

# Google Pay Integration

&emsp;These methods facilitate integrating Google Pay into your application through the SDK. Our SDK's methods bridge your Google Pay implementation with our payment gateway, handling the transaction processing.

&emsp;Before you begin, you must register and configure your application in the Google Pay Business Console.

- [1. Registering in Google Pay Business Console](#1-registering-in-google-pay-business-console)
- [2. Integrating the Google Pay SDK into your project](#2-integrating-the-google-pay-sdk-into-your-project)
- [3. Initialization of `PaymentsClient` and `PayButton`](#3-initialization-of-paymentsclient-and-paybutton)
- [4. Creating a Google Pay Transaction](#4-creating-a-google-pay-transaction)
- [5. Confirming a Google Pay Transaction](#5-confirming-a-google-pay-transaction)

## 1. Registering in Google Pay Business Console

> **NOTE**
> - **Sign Up for Google Pay Business Console**: Visit the Google Pay Business Console, sign in with a Google account, and click "Get Started".
> - **Create a Project & Set Up Android Integration**: Create a new project, navigate to "Google Pay API", and select "Create new integration". Enter your app's details, including the app name, "Android" as the platform, package name, and the SHA-1 certificate fingerprint.
> - **Configure Android Integration**: On the "Google Pay API → Android Integration" page, verify the package name and SHA-1 fingerprint to ensure the project is correctly linked to your app.
> - **Submit App Screenshots for Approval**: Google requires screenshots of your payment flow for review. You must upload screenshots of the item selection, pre-purchase confirmation, payment method selection with the Google Pay option, the Google Pay checkout screen, and the post-purchase confirmation. After uploading, click "Submit for approval" and await Google's review.
> - **Go Live with Google Pay**: Once approved, switch from test to production mode and test real transactions to ensure smooth payments.

## 2. Integrating the Google Pay SDK into your project

&emsp;After registering, integrate the Google Pay SDK into your app by adding the following dependency to your `build.gradle.kts` file:
```groovy
implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-wallet:19.2.1")
```

&emsp;Next, update your `AndroidManifest.xml` to enable the Google Pay API:
```xml
<application>
    ...
    <!-- Enables the Google Pay API -->
    <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.gms.wallet.api.enabled"
        android:value="true" />
</application>
```

&emsp;Add `PayButton` to your XML layout file where you want it to appear:
```xml
<com.google.android.gms.wallet.button.PayButton
    android:id="@+id/buttonPaymentByGoogle"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    />
```

## 3. Initialization of `PaymentsClient` and `PayButton`

&emsp;To initialize the payment button and the Google Pay `PaymentsClient` in your activity:
```kotlin
val googlePayButton: PayButton = findViewById(R.id.buttonPaymentByGoogle)
googlePayButton.initialize(
    ButtonOptions.newBuilder()
        .setButtonType(ButtonType.CHECKOUT)
        .setButtonTheme(ButtonTheme.LIGHT)
        .build()
)

val googlePaymentsClient = Wallet.getPaymentsClient(
    this,
    Wallet.WalletOptions.Builder()
        .setEnvironment(WalletConstants.ENVIRONMENT_PRODUCTION)
        .setTheme(WalletConstants.THEME_LIGHT)
        .build()
)
```

&emsp;The `Wallet.getPaymentsClient` method is used to get an instance of `PaymentsClient`. It has the following environments:

| Parameter                | Value                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| `ENVIRONMENT_PRODUCTION` | Production environment |
| `ENVIRONMENT_TEST`       | Test environment       |

                AutoResolveHelper.resolveTask(
                    googlePaymentsClient.loadPaymentData(createPaymentDataRequest()),
                    this,
                    REQUEST_CODE
                )
            }
            is FreedomResult.Error -> {
                // Failed to initiate Google Payment with SDK
            }
        }
    }
}

companion object {
  // The request code that will be used when calling.
  const val REQUEST_CODE = 123
}
```

> **NOTE**
> - `createPaymentDataRequest()` is a method that returns a `PaymentDataRequest` object. This object defines the parameters and requirements for the payment data request, such as payment methods, shipping address, and more.
> - `loadPaymentData()` initiates an asynchronous task to load payment data using the provided request.
> - `AutoResolveHelper.resolveTask<PaymentData>()`is used to handle the payment data loading task.
> - `REQUEST_CODE` is a request code used to identify the result of the task in the onActivityResult method.

### Step 4.2. `createPaymentDataRequest()` implementation

&emsp;Here is an example implementation of `createPaymentDataRequest()`:
```kotlin
private fun createPaymentDataRequest(): PaymentDataRequest {
  
    // Creating a new request builder.
    val request = PaymentDataRequest.newBuilder()
        // Setting transaction information.
        .setTransactionInfo( 
            TransactionInfo.newBuilder()
                .setTotalPriceStatus(WalletConstants.TOTAL_PRICE_STATUS_FINAL) // Total price status
                .setTotalPrice("12.00") // Total payment amount.
                .setCurrencyCode("KZT") // Currency code (e.g., 'KZT').
                .build()
        )
        // Specify the payment methods.
        .addAllowedPaymentMethod(WalletConstants.PAYMENT_METHOD_CARD)
        .addAllowedPaymentMethod(WalletConstants.PAYMENT_METHOD_TOKENIZED_CARD)
    
        // Setting requirements for the bank card.
        .setCardRequirements(
            CardRequirements.newBuilder()
                // Allowed card networks.
                .addAllowedCardNetworks(
                    Arrays.asList(
                        WalletConstants.CARD_NETWORK_VISA,
                        WalletConstants.CARD_NETWORK_MASTERCARD
                    )
                )
                .build()
        )
  
    // Setting payment method tokenization parameters.
    val params = PaymentMethodTokenizationParameters.newBuilder()
        // Tokenization type (in this case, payment gateway).
        .setPaymentMethodTokenizationType(
          WalletConstants.PAYMENT_METHOD_TOKENIZATION_TYPE_PAYMENT_GATEWAY
        )
        // Parameters for the payment gateway (e.g., 'gateway', 'gatewayMerchantId').
        .addParameter("gateway", "yourGateway")
        .addParameter("gatewayMerchantId", "yourMerchantIdGivenFromYourGateway")
        .build()
  
    // Passing tokenization parameters into the request.
    request.setPaymentMethodTokenizationParameters(params)
  
    return request.build()
}
```
> **NOTE**
> - `PaymentDataRequest.newBuilder()` creates a new builder for the payment data request.
> - `setTransactionInfo()` sets transaction information, such as the total payment amount and currency code.
> - `PaymentMethodTokenizationParameters.newBuilder()` creates a builder for the payment method tokenization parameters.
> - `setPaymentMethodTokenizationType()` sets the tokenization type (e.g., a payment gateway).
> - `addParameter()` adds parameters for the payment gateway, such as `gateway` and `gatewayMerchantId`.
> - `setPaymentMethodTokenizationParameters()` sets the tokenization parameters in the payment data request.

### Step 4.3. Handling the `onActivityResult`

&emsp;The result of the Google Pay task is handled in the `onActivityResult` method:
```kotlin
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
    when (requestCode) {
        REQUEST_CODE -> {
            when (resultCode) {
                Activity.RESULT_OK -> {
                    if (data == null) return

                    val googlePayToken = paymentData?.paymentMethodToken?.token ?: return
                    // After receiving the token, we confirm the payment by calling confirmGooglePayment.
                }
                AutoResolveHelper.RESULT_ERROR -> {
                    if (data == null) return

                    val status = AutoResolveHelper.getStatusFromIntent(data)
                    // Handle the error status...
                }
                else -> {}
            }
        }
        else -> {}
    }
}
```
> **NOTE**
> - `onActivityResult` is used to handle the results returned by the Google Pay integration activity.
> - `data` is the object containing the data returned by the activity.
> - `Activity.RESULT_OK` indicates the successful completion of the operation.
> - `AutoResolveHelper.RESULT_ERROR` indicates that an error occurred while resolving the request.

## 5. Confirming a Google Pay Transaction
&emsp;The `confirmGooglePayment` method is the final step in processing a Google Pay transaction with the SDK. After you have successfully obtained the Google Pay token from the Google Pay API (e.g., from PaymentData in onActivityResult), you pass this token along with the `googlePayment` received from [`createGooglePayment`](#step-41-create-google-payment) to this method to finalize the transaction.

&emsp;This method takes these parameters:

| Parameter  | Type                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `payment`  | `GooglePayment`                            | Payment previously obtained from a successful call to [`createGooglePayment`](#step-41-create-google-payment). See [`GooglePayment`](#googlepayment-structure) model. |
| `token`    | `String`                                   | Encrypted payment token received from the Google Pay API. This token contains the sensitive card data securely.                                                       |
| `onResult` | `(FreedomResult<PaymentResponse>) -> Unit` | Callback function that will be invoked with the final result of the Google Pay transaction confirmation. See [`PaymentResponse`](#paymentresponse-structure) model.   |

&emsp;The process returns an [`FreedomResult<PaymentResponse>`](#error-handling-and-results) object, which can be either:
- **Success**: Contains a `PaymentResponse` object.
- **Error**: Specifies the type of error that occurred.

```kotlin
sdk.confirmGooglePayment(
    payment = googlePayment,
    token = googlePayToken
) { result: FreedomResult<PaymentResponse> ->
    when (result) {
        is FreedomResult.Success -> {
            // Google Pay payment confirmation successful
        }
        is FreedomResult.Error -> {
            // Failed to confirm Google Pay payment with SDK
        }
    }
}
```

# Error Handling and Results
&emsp;All asynchronous operations in the SDK (methods with an `onResult` callback) return their outcome encapsulated within a `FreedomResult` sealed interface.

&emsp;The `FreedomResult` interface has two primary states: `Success` for successful completion and `Error` for any failures.

![Mind Map of Freedom Result — Light](documentation-assets/FreedomResult(Light).png#gh-light-mode-only)
![Mind Map of Freedom Result — Dark](documentation-assets/FreedomResult(Dark).png#gh-dark-mode-only)


## `FreedomResult.Success<T>`
- **Description**: Represents a successful completion of the SDK operation.
- `value: T`: Holds the actual result data of the operation. The type T will vary depending on the specific method called (e.g., PaymentResponse, List<Card>, Status).

## `FreedomResult.Error` Sub-Types
&emsp;The `Error` interface is a sealed hierarchy itself, providing distinct types of errors for more precise handling.

### 1. `ValidationError`
&emsp;Indicates that one or more inputs provided to the SDK method were invalid or did not meet specified constraints (e.g., `amount` out of range, `userId` format mismatch).
- `errors: List<ValidationErrorType>`: A list detailing all specific validation errors that occurred. For a comprehensive list of types, refer to the [`ValidationErrorType`](#validationerrortype-structure) table.

### 2. `PaymentInitializationFailed`
&emsp;Indicates a general failure during the initial setup or preparation of a payment, before it reaches the transaction processing stage.

### 3. `Transaction`
&emsp;Represents an error encountered by the payment gateway during the transaction processing (e.g., card declines, insufficient funds, 3D Secure failures).

- `errorCode: Int`: A numerical code representing a specific transaction error. You can find an up-to-date reference of error codes [here](https://customer.freedompay.kz/dev/error?lang=en).
- `errorDescription: String?`: A human-readable description of the transaction error, if available.

### 4. `NetworkError`
&emsp;Represents errors related to network connectivity or API responses. This is a sealed interface with several specific network error types:

- `Protocol`: Indicates an issue with the communication protocol or an unexpected response from the API.
  - `code: Int`: An HTTP status code or an internal protocol error code.
  - `body: String?`: The raw response body or a human-readable description of the protocol error, if available.

- `Connectivity`: Indicates problems related to the device's network connection. This sealed interface includes the following specific errors:
  - `ConnectionFailed`: The network connection could not be established.
  - `ConnectionTimeout`: The network request timed out.
  - `Integrity`: An issue with the integrity of the network connection (e.g., SSL/TLS certificate issues).
- `Unknown`: A general network error occurred that does not fall into more specific categories.

### 5. `InfrastructureError`
&emsp;Represents errors related to the internal state, configuration, or core components of the SDK. This is a sealed interface with several specific infrastructure error types:

- `SdkNotConfigured`: The SDK methods were called before `freedomApi.setConfiguration()` was successfully invoked.
- `SdkCleared`: The SDK methods were called after the SDK's internal state was cleared, preventing further operations.
- `ParsingError`: An error occurred while parsing data (e.g., a response from the server could not be deserialized).
- `WebView`: Errors specifically related to the internal `WebView` component used for displaying payment pages or frames. This sealed interface includes the following specific errors:
  - `PaymentViewIsNotInitialized`: A method requiring `PaymentView` was called, but `freedomApi.setPaymentView()` has not been called or the view is not ready.
  - `Failed`: A general error occurred during the payment process within the `WebView`, without a more specific cause.
